# Goal Breakdown App

## Overview

The Goal Breakdown App is a tool designed to help you systematically break down your goals into manageable steps. Whether you're tackling a project, planning your day, or setting personal objectives, this app guides you through the process of breaking down your goals into smaller, more achievable tasks.

## Features

- **Goal Input:** Start by entering the main goal you want to accomplish.
- **Tiered Breakdown:** The app prompts you to break down your goal into 5 smaller tasks.
- **Nested Branches:** Dive deeper by branching into one of the five tasks, breaking it down into 5 more sub-tasks, and so on.
- **Infinite Expansion:** The goal breakdown can continue indefinitely, allowing for a detailed and comprehensive task hierarchy.

## Future Plans

- **AI Integration:** We plan to incorporate an AI model to provide personalized recommendations for breaking down goals effectively.
- **Monetization:** Beyond a certain depth (e.g., 3 tiers), access to advanced features will require a subscription.
